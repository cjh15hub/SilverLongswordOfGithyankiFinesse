Adds alternative finesse longsword and shortsword variants  for the 'Silver Sword of the Astral Place'; Well suited for Dexterity based builds of Lae'zel or other Githyanki.

The Silver Sword of the Astral Plane has been modified to give a new Ability / Action that will transform the weapon into either a longsword or shortsword variant.
These new weapons have all the same passives and abilities as the original weapon, but have had their classification changed, along with base damage.
I have modified the longsword to also include the finesse property, similar to the Phalar Aluve.

If you would like to later revert the weapon back to its original form, or would like to try out the other variant, simply recast the spell to transform the weapon again, choosing the desired transfiguration. Note: This ability can only be used outside of combat.

The ability should automatically be added to your action bar in the first section, and is represented as the "Magic Weapon" icon.

I created this mod, because I was moved by Lae'zel's reaction for being rewarded with "The Silver Sword of the Astral Plane", but saddened that I would never have her use the weapon. I had re-stat and trained Lae'zel as a Dex Fighter, who dual wields, and this greatsword simply would not fit her now. So in order to give her the weapon she truly deserves, I set to work on making these variants. If you have a similar Dex based Githyanki, you also need these!

This is my first BG3 mod, and it certainly was a neat learning experience. I hope you all like it.
